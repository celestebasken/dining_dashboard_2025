Welcome to the UC Sustainable Procurement Dashboard!

This is a project of UC Berkeley Bonnie Reiss Global Food Initiative Fellows. This tool allows users to see what sustainable items are currently being purchased by UC campuses. It combines 
sustainable food purchasing data from multiple UC campuses, highlighting key attributes such as food category, supplier, distributor, and sustainability certifications. The data for this 
tool were kindly provided during the 2024-25 academic year by stakeholders from various campuses. If you are a UC procurement stakeholder 
and would like to add or edit data, please contact Celeste (information below).
            
It is our hope that this tool will help your campus to identify further opportunities to purchase sustainable products, in alignment with the UC Office of the President's goals.

### Use the menu on the left sidebar to:
- Search for food items by category, certification, campus, or region
- Explore supplier and distributor offerings
- View summaries of sustainability certifications

### What do we consider "Sustainable"
For the purposes of UCOP and the Bonnie Reiss fellowship, this database uses a narrow definition of sustainable.
- For most campuses, sustainable is defined by the Association for the Advancement of Sustainability in Higher 
Education's Sustainability Tracking, Assessment & Rating System (AASHE STARS). In short, this is a comprehensive list of standards
(with familiar names like USDA Organic, Fair Trade, etc) that they consider as sustainable.
- The only campuses that do not adhere to AASHE STARS are UC Health Campuses, which use Practice Greenhealth. Everything that is
considered sustainable under AASHE STARS is also counted under Pratice Greenhealth. However, there are some standards included in Practice
Greenhealth that are not part of AASHE STARS.
- This database includes standards from BOTH. The only relevant standard in our guide that is ONLY sustainable under Practice Greenhealth
is Best Aquaculture Practices, or BAP. (BAP is not part of STARS)
